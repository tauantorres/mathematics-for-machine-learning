    "In this assignment you will write a function to perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set.\n",
    "As a corollary, the procedure allows us to determine the dimension of the space spanned by the basis vectors, which is equal to or less than the space which the vectors sit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by completing a function for 4 basis vectors, before generalising to when an arbitrary number of vectors are given.\n",

    "which will select the m'th column (starting at zero).\n",

    "### `Matrices in Python`\n",
    "For this exercise, we shall make use of the @ operator again.\n",
    "Recall from the last exercise, we used this operator to take the dot product of vectors.\n",
    "In general the operator will combine vectors and/or matrices in the expected linear algebra way,\n",
    "i.e. it will be either the vector dot product, matrix multiplication, or matrix operation on a vector, depending on it's input.\n",
    "For example to calculate the following expressions,\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a = \\mathbf{s}\\cdot\\mathbf{t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathbf{s} = A\\mathbf{t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M = A B $,\n",
    "\n",
    "One would use the code,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = s @ t\n",
    "s = A @ t\n",
    "M = A @ B\n",
    "```\n",
    "(This is in contrast to the $*$ operator, which performs element-wise multiplication, or multiplication by a scalar.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to use some of the following functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inv(A)\n",
    "transpose(A)\n",
    "gsBasis(A)\n",
    "```\n",
    "These, respectively, take the inverse of a matrix, give the transpose of a matrix, and produce a matrix of orthonormal column vectors given a general matrix of column vectors - i.e. perform the Gram-Schmidt process.\n",
    "This exercise will require you to combine some of these functions.\n"
